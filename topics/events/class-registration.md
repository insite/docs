# What Learners see on the Class Registration Portal Page

On the Classes Search page in the Portal, users will see various statuses. The flowchart below illustrates the different statuses visible to users:

During the **Class Registration** process, there are 5 steps the user will move through to complete their registration:

1. Update your account information (_Accounts panel_)
2. Select Employer (_Employer panel_)
3. Choose Payment option - Seat selection (_Class Registration panel_)
4. Enter Payment info (_Payment panel_)
5. Confirm (_Confirm Details & Payment panel_)

In the **Accounts** and **Employer** panels, there are Organization specific settings and fields that can be turned on/off. These settings can **only** be turned on/off by an **Shift iQ administrator**.

Shift iQ Administrator Note: See Confluence for the different settings for the Class Registration page.
