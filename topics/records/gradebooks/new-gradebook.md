# Creating a New Gradebook

Create a Gradebook from an Assessment Form:

1. On the **Admin Home** page, click **Assessments Toolkit**, then select the **Banks** tile
2. Using the **Criteria** tab, search for the Bank that contains the Form you want to use.
3. In the **Results** tab, click the **Bank Name** to open it.
4. Click the **Forms** tab and choose the Form for which you want to create a Gradebook.
   * If you still need to create a Form, see:\

5. Click on the **Form** tab. Under the **Identification** section, click the **edit (pencil) icon** next to the  **Gradebook** heading.
6. Select **Create Gradebook**, then click **Save**.
7. The system automatically creates the Gradebook and corresponding Grade Items. Each question in the Form becomes a Grade Item, allowing you to view a learner’s score for each question directly in the Gradebook.
