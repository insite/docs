# Survey Invitation

### Create an Invitation from a Survey

* Open the [**Survey**](../../../ui/help/portal/surveys/searching-surveys/) that you want to send the invitation for.
* Click on **Messages** tab and then the **Invitation** tab.
* Click on the **Add Invitation** button.
* Add the **Internal Name** and **Subject**.
* Then select the **Save** button.
* After saving you will be redirected to the **Message Outline** page where you can modify the invitaion's content, under the **Content** tab. **Please note:** Do not remove the {Survey-Link} placeholder that is in the content message content.
* Under the **Subcribers** tab, add the user you want to send the **Survey Invitation** to.
  * Add existing contacts to a message individually
  * Add existing contacts to a message as a group
  * Create new contacts directly from this form
  * Bulk upload contacts directly to a message
* After adding the **Subscribers** scheduled the mailout for the **Date** and **Time** you want it to send out. This can be done by clicking on the **Schedule Mailout** button under the **Mailouts** or **Messages Setup** tabs.<br>

### Create an Invitation from the Messages Toolkit

* Click on the **Messages** toolkit and then select the **Invitation** counter.
* Click on the **Add New Invitation** link at the top of the page.
* Add information into the following fields:
  * **Survey Form** - A link to this survey must be included in the body of the invitation email.
  * Add the **Internal Name** and **Subject**.
* Under the **Content** tab, add the\*\* Content\*\* you want included in your **Invitiation**. This will be the body of the message the respondent receives via email.
* Add Subscribers/Recipients
  * Add existing contacts to a message individually
  * Add existing contacts to a message as a group
  * Create new contacts directly from this form
  * Bulk upload contacts directly to a message
* Set Workflow Notifications to notify your administrator when the Survey response started and completed. A notification can also be sent to the Respondent once the survey response is completed.
* Schedule current and future mailouts through the Messages toolkit. When a survey invitation is sent, it will exclude the recipients who have already answered the survey.

Even if you have multiple recipients, you can choose to send to only one using the paper airplane icon on the Subscribers/Recipients panel.<br>

### Removing recipients from a Survey Invitation

View and edit survey subscribers/respondents through the Messages toolkit, not through the Surveys toolkit.

* Open the **Messages** Toolkit and search for the **Invitation** you need to remove recipients (Subscribers) for.
* Under the **Subscriber** tab and click on the Trash Can icon (<i class="fa-trash-alt">:trash-alt:</i>) next to the subscribers name.
* Confirm you want to remove the subscriber by clicking on the\*\* Delete\*\* button.

**Note:** When a survey invitation is sent, it will exclude the recipients who have already answered the survey.<br>

### Send a reminder by scheduling a mailout

You can use a survey invitation to send reminders by scheduling a mailout. Reminders are only sent to people who have not yet completed a response to the survey. People on the Subscriber list are excluded if they have completed the survey. Prior to scheduling a reminder mailout, we recommend that you edit the subject and contents of the invitation to indicate that it is a reminder, not a new invitation.<br>
