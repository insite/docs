# Adding Home/Return to Course buttons at end of Survey

When user completes a survey, there is no Home or Return to Course buttons available to click on to take a user out of the survey.\
We have a workaround in place by manually  adding the code for a Home or Return to Course button in the Survey's Completed Instructions under the Content Panel. The text before and after the button code can be edited to add or remove information. \
E.g.\
Thank you for completing the Carpenter Self-Assessment! \
&#xNAN;_\<a href="/ui/portal/courses/outline?course=INSERT COURSE ASSET NUMBER" class="btn btn-success">ADD TEXT FOR BUTTON  HERE\</a>_\
Click the Continue button to review your completed application. To return to your Home Page, click on the NBCC logo at the top left.\
