# Creating survey forms

To create a new survey form, click on the **Surveys** toollkit on the Admin Home Screen, then select the **Survey** counter.

Click on **Add New Survey** at the top of the Survey search page.

Select the **Internal Name** (Required) for your survey. The internal name is used as a reference for filing purposes. It is required, but it is not visible to the survey respondent.

Select **Limit Responses per Respondent**, **Allow Anonymous Responses** and **Confidentiality for Respondents** settings for the Survey.

* **Limit Responses per Respondent**
  * Limited - Allows respondents to answer the survey only once, but also allows identification of respondent. The Start Survey button goes away once a respondent has taken the survey once. To allow them to take it again, you must either:
    * Turn off the Limit response option
    * Delete the respondent’s answers
  * Not Limited - Allows respondents to answer the survey an unlimited amount of times, and also allow anonymous responses.<br>
* **Allow Anonymous Responses** Allow users to answer the survey without identifying themselves and without signing in. Please Note: Allow Anonymous Responses is only availble if **Not Limited** is selected under **Limit Responses per Respondent** settings<br>
* **Confidentiality for Respondents** Enable this setting if you do not want to disclose confidential/personal information about survey respondents to survey administrators.<br>

Click the **Save** button.

Alternatively, click on the **New** button when in any active survey, add the **Internal Name** and click on the **Save** button.

A survey can also be created by uploading a JSON (.json) file.

1. On the Create New Survey page, select Upload one new survey from a file from the dropdown list at the top of the page.
2. Next to the Select and Upload JSON File field, click on the File icon to select JSON (.json) file.
3. Once your file is selected, click on the Upload icon.
4. Click the Save button. After the upload is complete, you will be able to make edits to the newly created survey (e.g. Internal Name, External Title and Survey Questions).
