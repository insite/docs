# Creating a New Version of a Question

After creating questions for a bank, you may need to update or revise the questions or answer options while still keeping the original question data and any associated attempts intact.

1. Open the question you want to create a new version of and click the edit pencil next to the question.
2.  On the right side of the page, click on the little arrow below the **Current Version** heading.&#x20;

3. The Publication Status of the question will update to **Drafted (In Development)**.&#x20;
4. You can now edit the Question Text and Answer Options as needed. The original Question and Answer Options will remain as is.

After you updated the new version of that question:

* If a form has a **Specification Type = Static**, the question will _not_ update automatically across the forms where it’s used. You’ll need to manually remove the old question and add the updated one. See [How to Add/Remove Questions from a Assessment Form](how-to-add-remove-questions-from-a-assessment-form.md)
* If a form has a **Specification Type = Dynamic**, the question _is_ automatically updated everywhere it’s used, and those updates become immediately available to learners.
