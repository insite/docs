# Oct 29: Version 25.6 is live!

This update includes meaningful improvements across workflows, catalogs, and logbooks, reflecting ongoing enhancements to the platform and feedback from our customers. Each change focuses on simplifying day-to-day tasks, improving visibility, and maintaining the platform’s reliability.

&#x20;Here’s a quick look at what’s new:

* Program requests create workflow cases automatically for faster approvals
* New Program Catalog lets learners browse and request multiple programs
* Administrators can organize programs by both catalog and category
* Supervisors now see only cases linked to their direct reports
* Logbook data is clearer with competency ordering and validation tracking
* Simplified nav menus and updated survey tools enhance admin usability
* Class reminder notifications keep learners and instructors on schedule&#x20;
* Platform updates strengthen stability and support faster future releases

These updates make the Shift iQ platform even more responsive and efficient for both administrators and learners.
