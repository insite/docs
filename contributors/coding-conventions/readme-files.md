# README files

A README is a short summary of the contents of a directory. It provide critical information for people browsing your code, especially first-time users.

The contents of the file are displayed in GitHub when you view the contents of the containing directory. For example, the README.md file is rendered when you view the contents of the containing directory:

## Readable README files <a href="#readable-readme-files" id="readable-readme-files"></a>

README files must be named `README.md`

The file name must be uppercase `README`, and the file extension must be lowercase `md` .&#x20;

This causes it to stand out — because lowercase and Title Case filenames are much more common. Also, on [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems, the [`ls`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls) command sorts and displays files in [ASCII-code order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCIIbetical), so uppercase filenames appear first.

## Where to put your README <a href="#where-to-put-your-readme" id="where-to-put-your-readme"></a>

`README.md` files should be located in the top-level directory for each library's codebase.

All top-level directories for a source code package should have a current `README.md` file. This is especially important for package directories that provide interfaces for other teams.

## What to put in your README <a href="#what-to-put-in-your-readme" id="what-to-put-in-your-readme"></a>

At a minimum, your `README.md` file should contain a link to user- and/or team-facing documentation.

Every package-level `README.md` should include (or link to) the following information:

1. A summary of the purpose and contents of the package or library.
2. A list of relevant contacts.
3. The status of the package or library. For example, is it deprecated, not for general release, etc.
4. A description of how to use the package or library.
5. Links to additional relevant documentation.
