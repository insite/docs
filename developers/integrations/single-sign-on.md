  Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in
  with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.

# Single Sign-On

Refer to this Wikipedia article for background information about [Single Sign-On](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on).

Shift iQ supports three industry-standard mechanisms for SSO:

1. Azure (Office 365)
2. Google
3. Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)

We do not implement or support custom SSO mechanisms due to the potential security and privacy risks associated with them.

### Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) <a href="#learning-tools-interoperability-lti" id="learning-tools-interoperability-lti"></a>

Here are some additional details for using LTI for SSI with the Shift iQ platform.

While LTI is not primarily designed as a SSO mechanism, some of the data it passes in a launch request is about the user. LTI works on the basis of a trust relationship between systems, which is established by means of a key and a secret. This makes it much simpler than providing access to a common identity server.

In LTI, a user is authenticated by a primary system and then can be passed to another system (internal or external) by way of a signed launch message. The system that receives this message verifies its authenticity by inspecting its digital signature, and then implicitly trusting the data it carries; thereby eliminating the need to authenticate the user a second time or reconfirm the user’s identity.

This approach makes LTI a low-cost option for implementing SSO between systems.

Refer to this article for details: [LTI as a SSO Mechanism](https://www.imsglobal.org/learning-tools-interoperability-sso-mechanism)

An LTI launch message submitted for SSO access to Shift iQ looks something like this:

The LTI Launch message is signed with a secure digital signature, using [HMAC-SHA1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.hmacsha1?view=net-7.0) or [HMAC-SHA256](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.hmacsha256?view=net-7.0), with a secret key that is shared between the two systems.

When Shift iQ receives this message from a user’s web browser, it validates the signature on the message to confirm it is a legitimate interoperability request from an authorized external system.

If request is valid, then Shift iQ authenticates the learner and navigates to the requested course in the Shift iQ Learning Portal.
